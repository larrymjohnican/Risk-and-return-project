# Investment Analysis using the Sharpe Ratio
This project focuses on investment analysis and aims to calculate and compare the profitability and risk of different investments using the Sharpe Ratio. The Sharpe Ratio is a widely used measure in finance that helps assess the performance of an investment by taking into account both its returns and the associated risk.
## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to have the pandas and matplotlib libraries installed. You can install these libraries using pip: pip install pandas matplotlib
This project also utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis. You can install Jupyter Notebooks using pip: pip install jupyter.
Additionally, the datasets are provided in a zip file.
## Usage
The project is written in Python and utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, matplotlib for data visualization, and Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis. To use the project, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebooks.
Prepare your investment data in a suitable format. The data should include historical returns for different investments.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file (investment_analysis.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebooks.
Modify the provided code cells to read and process your investment data. You may need to adjust the code to match the structure and format of your data.
Run the modified code cells to calculate the Sharpe Ratio for each investment and visualize the results using matplotlib.
Analyze the results to compare the profitability and risk of different investments.
Please note that this project assumes you have a basic understanding of Python, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebooks. It provides a starting point and framework for investment analysis but may require customization to fit your specific requirements.
